            While this mobile game was released in 2023 (launched on March 27 2024 for IOS, 
            Android, & PC), it also came to somewhat forward knowledge by sponsoring 
            multiple popular english speaking youtubers through 
            codes to redeem rewards upon opening the game, as well as generally convincing 
            the sponsee to endorse them with their own forms of advertisment.
            <br>
            Servers for "co-op" allow several people to see each other on anywhere in the 
            map, while excluding those who aren't on the same server. This, however, has been 
            proven to be annoying, as you can only change the server you're on before you even 
            start playing the game, with no other way to join servers.
            <br>
            Either way, any server that was created on March 27 was given access to the first 
            season (Song of Strife) on May 10th, with this season ending around September 17th, 
            2024. On September 19th, most servers that were a certain amount of time old were 
            then given access to the second season, Waves of Intrigue.
