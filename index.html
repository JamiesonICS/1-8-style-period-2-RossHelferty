            Some fun stuff happened last night.
        </h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 6px;">
            Basically, there's this game that I like playing at home 
            called <em>AFK journey</em>.
        </h2>
        <p>
            It's just a goofy mobile game that has its own lore & stuff, 
            along with a ton of gacha mechanics.
            <br>
            Monday night, I was playing around with the game when I received a newsletter 
            through the application. Although I didn't think much of it, when I read it, 
            I found out some interesting news, which is that they were running a competition. 
            While I normally don't participate in these kinds of things, I wanted to challenge
            myself, and found myself reading through the rules and such.
            <br>
            Turns out, whoever wins gets $1000 (as well as some in-game rewards), and 
            although I know I won't win, I found the general idea to be interesting (since 
            it would give me something to do after school that wasn't lying down on the floor 
            for 5 hours straight), and so since last night, I've been brainstorming different 
            ideas for what video I could make for the competition. I've been thinking about 
            what I could do, and decided to start with a video. Since this morning, I've been
            trying to figure out how to compose a song so that I wouldn't have to worry about 
            royalties.

            Anyways,

        <h3>
            AFK Journey is a mobile game with gacha 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">

            mechanics that follows a mostly strict storyline, requiring you to complete quests
            to enter various areas, eventually giving you access to extra seasons when you 
            finish the starter story. Although it would be spoilers to explain the entire 
            story, I would still believe that it'd be alright to describe the begining; 
        </h3>

        <ul style="color: rgb(134, 180, 217);">
            <li>You wake up in a house in a world named "Esperia"</li>
            <li>Some girl walks up to you (referring to you as Magister Merlin), excited to see 
                that you're awake</li>
            <li>She then realises that you have amnesia. Again.</li>
            <li>She tells you to leave the house because the village is on fire & you have to 
                save the people</li>
            <li>When you leave the house (after setting up your character's appearence & new name 
                since you can't go around town as the most famous person in Esperia), all of the 
                hay in the area known as Golden Wheatshire 1 is on fire, & you go around battling 
                monsters & helping civillians out from trapped locatios with the help of your two 
                hamster familliars</li>
            <li>Eventually, you go to find the culprit who started the fire, & find yourself 
                battling against a terribly strong foe, eventually coughing up your own power, 
                divine smiting the enemy (rather than having your familliars fight for you, like 
                they normally do) and then you pass out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            AFK Journey is also made by some company or brand I believe to be called 
            "Lillith". While this game was initially released in <em><a href="./pages/history.html" 
            style="color: rgb(129, 193, 231);">December 6, 2023</a></em>, it seems to 
            currently be in it's second "extra" season, and the developers are still 
            planning on adding new content as time goes on.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Currently, there are about 57 characters that you can use with the help 
            of the gatcha system, while the developers are continuing to add new 
            characters as the seasons of new content drag on.
